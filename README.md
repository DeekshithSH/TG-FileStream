**TG-FileStream** is a lightweight web server and Telegram client that acts as a proxy between Telegram servers and HTTP clients, allowing direct downloads of Telegram media files via HTTP.

---

## 🔁 Project Background

This project is a **successor** to  
👉 [DeekshithSH/TG-FileStreamBot](https://github.com/DeekshithSH/TG-FileStreamBot),  
which itself was a fork of  
👉 [EverythingSuckz/TG-FileStreamBot](https://github.com/EverythingSuckz/TG-FileStreamBot).

The original Python version became inactive after EverythingSuckz rewrote the project in Golang. Instead of continuing from the older Python codebase, this project is a fresh rewrite using [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) with a minimal approach.

> 📌 Check out [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for the latest development progress and planned features.

- `MULTI_TOKENx`: Use Multiple Telegram Clients when downloading files to avoid flood wait, Replace x with Number

example:
```
MULTI_TOKEN1=1234567890:AAExampleBotTokenGeneratedHere
MULTI_TOKEN2=0987654321:AAExampleBotTokenGeneratedHere
MULTI_TOKEN3=5432167890:AAExampleBotTokenGeneratedHere
```

## 📂 Usage

Once the server is running, you can:

- Access Telegram media files via HTTP:

```
http://{PUBLIC_URL}/{message_id}/{filename}
```

- Or simply send a file to your bot, and it will respond with a download link.

This will stream the file directly from Telegram servers to the client.
